# Fair Share Cost Calculator


A new way to share costs with your friends, from each according to their ability, to each according to their need!

I built this calculator because my friends wanted to go on fun group trips, but we had a wide range of incomes (some of us were students, others had been working professionally for years). Splitting group costs (like vacation rentals) evenly down the middle limited us because we had really different willingness to pay. Those with more cash to burn would have been happy to pay more and cover the difference if it meant being able to do the bigger adventure. 

The Fair Share Cost Calculator helps you figure out how to split a big bill in a way that's fair to everyone. Each person in the group enters the amount of money they'd be happy to pay. If it's over the average amount, the calculator distributes excess to cover the need of anyone who listed under the average amount.
